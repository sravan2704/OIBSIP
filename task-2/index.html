            <h2>About Me</h2>
            Hello, I'm Sravan, a passionate and creative web developer based in Hyderabad. With a strong foundation in web technologies, I enjoy turning ideas into reality through the power of coding. My journey in the world of web development started with a fascination for creating interactive and user-friendly experiences.
            </p>
            <p>
                I specialize in front-end development, where I bring designs to life using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I am dedicated to crafting responsive and visually appealing websites that not only meet but exceed user expectations. Constantly keeping up with the latest industry trends and technologies, I strive to enhance my skills and stay at the forefront of web development.
            </p>
            <p>
                Outside of coding, you'll find me exploring new technologies, contributing to open-source projects, and staying connected with the tech community. I believe in the power of collaboration and am always open to new challenges that allow me to learn and grow as a developer.
            </p>
